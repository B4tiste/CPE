# La Tour Montparnasse Infernale : A French Comedy Worth Watching

Have you ever pondered what makes French comedy unique? "La Tour Montparnasse Infernale," a 2001 French crime comedy film, offers a perfect glimpse into this world. Directed by Charles Nemes, this film not only showcases the quirks of French humor but also became a box office hit, earning over 20.6 million against a 9.6 million budget.

The plot revolves around Éric and Ramzy, two window washers at the Montparnasse skyscraper in Paris. The twist comes when a gang of terrorists captures the tower, taking its occupants, including Éric's love interest, Marie-Joëlle, hostage. This unexpected turn propels our unlikely heroes into an action-packed and hilarious rescue mission.

This movie stands out for its blend of slapstick comedy and action, a combination not often seen in French cinema. It offers a refreshing perspective on Paris, far from the romantic clichés, presenting the city with an a humorous twist. Its unique brand of comedy is both accessible and distinctly French, making it a must-watch for anyone looking to broaden their cinematic horizons.

I strongly recommend "La Tour Montparnasse Infernale" to anyone with an appetite for comedy and a love for cultural exploration. It's a film that not only entertains but also provides insight into French culture and humor. Don't miss this comedic gem!
