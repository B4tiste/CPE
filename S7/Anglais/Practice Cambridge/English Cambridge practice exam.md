# A brief report about the BREF French comedy show

1. Introduction to BREF, who did it and what is it all about
2. Why would anyone enjoy and love this work of art

&emsp;*BREF* is a comedy show created by **Kyan Khojandi** and **Bruno Muschio** in 2011, and was released on the **CANAL+** French television channel. In 2017, all the *BREF* episodes were uploaded to the YouTube website, and now everyone can view it for free. The show consists of 82 short videos (around 1min45 each) following the life and adventures of the main protagonist, whose first and last names we do not know throughout the whole show. He has to meet new people, find a new job or just interact with his family and the world around him. The title of the show means “short” or “brief” in French, hence the duration of each episode. The title word is a gimmick, with the main character repeating it numerous times during the show.

&emsp;The first thing that seduce the audience is the fact that the main characters is someone like you and me, just a citizen in his country, nothing fancy to brag about. This helps a lot to identify yourself as the hero of this show, and this also applies to the things he does during is life. The 11th episode of the show is literally called “I am like everyone else”, and describe all the little things that he does or thinks about during his day, like believing if someone watches you when you’re in the restroom, telling us that he chokes on every tiramisu chocolate powder, forgetting to attach a file in an email and then re-send one with it saying “With this attached file, it’s much better !!”. Every single episode can be viewed as a memory or a piece of thoughts that you had once. This can be especially applied to the viewer experience when the episode main character get lost in thoughts, then goes back to the point with a sentence starting with a “Bref, I ...”, often summarize and conclude the episode.
